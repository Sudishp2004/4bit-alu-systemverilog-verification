# 4bit-alu-systemverilog-verification
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog and verifies it using a SystemVerilog class-based verification environment.  The verification architecture includes generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard, and environment modules to validate functional correctness.
