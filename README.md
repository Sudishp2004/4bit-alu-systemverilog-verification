4-bit ALU Design & Verification
This project implements a synthesizable **4-bit ALU in Verilog** and verifies it using a **SystemVerilog class-based testbench**.
The verification environment includes generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard components to automatically validate ALU operations under randomized inputs.
Tools:
Verilog, SystemVerilog, EDA Playground, QuestaSim  

Built to demonstrate practical understanding of RTL design and functional verification flow used in VLSI projects.
